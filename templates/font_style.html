    <h2>What is mealCurator?</h2>
    <p>mealCurator is built to help you:

       <li>Provide a safe space to stash your planned meals</li>
       <li>Links out to your planned meal so you can easily find that recipe</li>
       <li>Do the hard work and find recipes for you</li>

        <br>
        <br>
        Once logged in you can submit recipes you find around around the internet.  Submitting recipes helps us build our databases and makes the overall platform more powerful.  It typically takes about 10 minutes from submission of recipe until it is ready to be added to a meal plan.  Sometimes certain websites will not allow us to collect enough information, or are behind a paywall.  At this time these recipes wont be able to be added to a meal plan.
    </p>
    <h2>Issues</h2>
    <p>The best place to look for a resolution to any problems will be in the <a href="{% url 'welcome' %}">'How-To'</a> section.  Bugs are definately going to appear.  If you have an issue that you can't solve with the How-To documentation, feel free to submit an issue to the <a href="https://github.com/jtweeder/mealcurator" target="_blank">github repository</a> and we can take a look.
